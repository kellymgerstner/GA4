                    <p>I have always loved learning and helping others so when it came time to choose my career, teaching seemed like the obvious choice. I studied and practiced and graduated with a Bachelors in Music Education and began teaching in 2006. I worked in Riverview Gardens School District for 14 years as a teacher, mentor, coach, and administrator. My favorite part of my job was building relationships with the students and their families.  As a music teacher, I was in the unique position to teach the same students every year which allowed for deep and meaningful connections. Helping the students realize their potential and connecting them with the support they needed to succeed was incredibly rewarding. In my time there I taught Kindergarten through 12th grade as well as my colleagues.  It was amazing to see the students I taught to play recorder in elementary school walk across the graduation stage.</p>

                    <p>In addition to teaching, I was elected by my colleagues to serve as a union leader. I was on the executive board of our NEA for 8 years and was president of the organization for 3 years. I negotiated the contract between the district and the teachers and worked for better learning and teaching environments in our schools. I became an expert in policy and educational law as well as conflict mediation. The work ultimately was too confrontational for my personality. I want to cooperate to help people to improve things and felt too often that my hands were tied. Eventually I passed the torch to the next leader and refocused my efforts at the school level. By that time I was working as the high school choir director as well as the district wide coordinator for performing arts.</p>

                    <p>While working at the high school, our district was selected to partner with Apple as part of their ConnectEd initiative. The program allowed for one to one technology integration in our secondary schools. More than 2000 iPads and MacBooks were distributed to staff and students, many of whom were unfamiliar with the technogy and software. I volunteered to be on the team of teachers who learned the programs first and then trained our colleagues. I enjoyed planning and leading the professional development sessions and was surprised to find I like teaching adults as much as children.</p>
                    <p>For the last two years of my teaching career, I worked as a high school administrator focused on improving school culture and increasing attendance. I used my deeper understanding of technology to streamline our processes, organize events, survey different populations, and track data on over 1000 students.</p>

                    <h2>The Parent</h2>
                    <p>Schools transitioned to exclusively online learning in April 2020 due to Covid-19 and everything changed. Not only was I now working from home, I was doing it while assisting my three elementary age sons. We made it through the end of the school year, but when fall came my district wanted me to come back to work but my children were still learning remotely. Our family made the decision that I would leave my job and stay with the boys ensuring they stayed on track with their virtual classes.</p>

                    <h2>The Learner</h2>
                    <p>Transitioning from a more than full time career to only three students was difficult for me.  My mind craved problems to solve and 5th grade math wasn't cutting it. A friend told me about CoderGirl and suggested it might be a good fit for me. I looked into the program and applied. I was stunned and excited to be accepted and immediately got to work. There have been many times during the course of the program that I have felt unequal to the task, but every time I overcome the challenge it feels amazing -- like if I can do this, I can do anything.</p>

                    <p>My goal is to secure a programming job so I can continue working from home and caring for my family. Eventually I'd like to build a website that connects people in need with support services in their area.</p>
